# LiveWell (working title)

A mobile-first wellbeing app (PWA) focused on daily routines/habits and mood check-ins, with an optional AI companion **Liv** for support. Designed to feel like a native app (installable, runs full-screen).

## What this repo is
- We’ll write **small, plain-English tasks** that an AI coding agent (Codex) turns into **Pull Requests (PRs)**.
- You (the human) just check that the PR’s **checks are green** and click **Merge**.
- No terminal required for v0.1.

## MVP features (v0.1)
- ✅ Installable **PWA** shell (home-screen app, offline basics)
- ✅ **Habits / routine** checklist with streaks
- ✅ **Mood check-ins** + simple weekly review
- ▢ Optional **AI chat** (**Liv**) with safety guardrails

## How we’ll work
1) Add a task file under `/tasks/` (e.g., `TASK-01-PWA-baseline.md`).
2) In ChatGPT (Codex), say: “Implement `/tasks/TASK-01-PWA-baseline.md` and open a PR.”
3) When the PR shows green checks, **Merge**.

**Next step after this README:** create the first task file: `/tasks/TASK-01-PWA-baseline.md`.
